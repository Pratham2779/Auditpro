### AuditPro - Jewellery Audit Management System

**Live Demo:** [AuditPro Live](https://auditpro.prathamesh.site/)

**Overview:**
AuditPro replaces manual spreadsheet-based jewellery audits with a centralized, auditable workflow. It allows admins to assign inventory audits, and auditors to scan items efficiently with a real-time matching engine that classifies items as matched, unmatched, or missing. The system also generates detailed PDF reports for compliance and record-keeping.

**Features:**

* **Role-based dashboards:** Separate interfaces for Admins and Auditors.
* **Responsive frontend:** Single-page React application with fast search and filtering.
* **Backend:** RESTful APIs with clear controller/service separation; secured with token-based authentication.
* **CSV/XLSX ingestion & indexing:** Supports EPC/CPC barcode processing.
* **Barcode scanning pipeline:** Real-time matching engine for inventory classification.
* **Notifications & chat:** Persistent in-audit chat and automated notifications.
* **File & report management:** Cloud media storage with local fallback; automated PDF generation of audit summaries and trails.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Storage:** Cloudinary (media files)

If you want, I can **also write a concise 2–3 line “short GitHub description”** suitable for the repo main page — something eye-catching for recruiters.

Do you want me to do that too?
